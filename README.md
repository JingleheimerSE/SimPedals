# Overview
The goal of this project was to build an approachable, affordable, and well documented DIY hydraulic sim racing pedal system. More specifically:

- [x] [Technical Background](./Documentation/TechnicalBackground.md) should be well documented for newcomers
- [x] Total cost of the project should not exceed $500 USD
- [x] Mechanical elements should be easy to assemble and well documented
- [x] The electrical components should easy to assemble and well documented
- [x] The software should be modular and well documented

Given these goals, the project can be broken into two major areas:
* Mechanical
* Electronics

# Mechanical

# Electronics
The electronics in a DIY pedal system are not very complex, yet most tutorials found online in my opinion do not provide enough insight for a novice to get their bearings. In hopes that. and an in depth [Technical Background](./Documentation/TechnicalBackground.md)
